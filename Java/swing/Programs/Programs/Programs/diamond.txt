Suppose, class A has a method m()
Then, class B and Class C extends A. Suppose, B overrides m()
Then, class D extends from both of B and C and it is not overriding m().

I have two abstract classes A1, B1
All methods in A1 and B1 are abstract
Suppose A1 and B1 both has m(), but both of them are unimplemented.
Eventually, if D would be allowed to extend from both A1 and B1, eventually D will
have to implement m()
